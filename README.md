## Glimr Swift SDK

A lightweight SDK for iOS (Swift) that collects and extracts location data from Glimr, a location intelligence provider for publishers. 

The documentation for the Swift SDK is currently produced, but very similar to the Glimr ObjC framework. 
Further documentation can be found here: https://developer.glimr.io/docs/ios
